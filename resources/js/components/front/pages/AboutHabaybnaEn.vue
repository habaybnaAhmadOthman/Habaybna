                <p dir="ltr"><strong>Habaybna.net</strong>&nbsp;is an online resource and learning hub that provides specialized content on developmental disabilities in Arabic throughout the Arab region. The new platform was launched in&nbsp;<strong>December 2017</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;aims to empower parents by providing customized knowledge – in Arabic – through articles and video interviews with experts giving practical guidance, as well as interviews with parents sharing their personal experiences and recommendations. Another important goal of&nbsp;<strong>Habaybna.net</strong>&nbsp;is to contest the negative stereotypes facing children with disability and focus on their special talents instead.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The founders, Reem and Mohammed Alafranji got inspired to establish&nbsp;<b>Habaybna.net</b>&nbsp;from their own journey with their two sons with developmental disability. Aboud and Amro both have a Global Developmental Delay, which the parents accidentally discovered in 2009.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“The name of the new online resource,<b>&nbsp;Habaybna</b>&nbsp;means “Our beloved ones” in Arabic, Reem Alafranji explains. “It reflects our firm belief that our children are our beloved ones regardless of their abilities.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">When Reem and Mohammed discovered their children’s challenges, they tried to find out where to start their new life journey and how to best support their sons.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“It turned out we couldn’t find any reliable resources in Arabic that would provide guidance and practical information,” Mohammed says. There were many websites and articles in English but that information was not customized to an Arab audience, and did not explain which resources and services were available in the Arab countries.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Clearly, this is a major challenge in the Middle East for parents with children who have developmental disabilities, so we decided to do something to address this”, Reem says.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><b>Fighting stereotypes</b></p>

<p dir="ltr">Many parents with children with disabilities not only face information shortages but also negative stereotypes in society about their children. In the media, children with disabilities always look miserable or helpless.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“It was not until we had our sons attending the right and specialized programs, that we started to change our perspective and realize that children with disabilities are just like anyone else, they are gifted and have talents,” Reem says. “What they need is to get the specialized programs that cater to their uniqueness. With a bit of awareness and alternative thinking, children with disabilities can be included in the community and become active members.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">The online platform&nbsp;<b>Habaybna.net</b>&nbsp;aims to provide specialized Arabic content and resources on developmental disabilities, and to collect and share the knowledge and experiences of families with similar journeys throughout the Middle East in addition to specialists share their experiences. The platform includes a video library featuring specialists and parents, useful articles and soon, a directory with resources and services available in MENA for people with developmental disabilities and their families.</p>
